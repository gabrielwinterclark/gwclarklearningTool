    <h1>A Very Tiny Crash Course in Intrinsic Value</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objective 2: Understand intrinsic vs. extrinsic value</h2>
    <p> <ol> <li> Skill 1: Identify when someone is assigning intrinsic value to something (second definition) </li>
    <li> Skill 2: Identify when someone is assigning extrinsic value to something </li> </ol> </p>
    <p> In the last learning objective, we learned about the first definition of intrinsic value. 
    Now, we will move on to the second definition of intrinsic value, 
    and its corresponding “opposite”: extrinsic value. </p>
	
    <h3> Skill 1: Identify when someone is assigning intrinsic value to something (second definition) </h3>
    <p> By the second definition, a thing has intrinsic value when its value arises from nonrelational properties, or properties that are separate from that thing.</p>
    <p> For example, I think the painting <i>Starry Night</i> by Vincent Van Gogh is valuable 
    because of its colors and shapes. I don’t value it because it was painted by a famous artist, 
    or because it makes me feel something. I value the painting for its <i>nonrelational properties</i>. 
    The colors and shapes are <i>inseparable</i> from the painting. So, I value it <i>intrinsically</i> by this second 
    definition. </p>
    <p><img src="images/starrynight.jpg" alt="A picture of the Starry Night painting by Vincent Van Gogh"></p>
    <p> Imagine the painting in a vacuum. No, not that kind of vacuum! I’m talking about a sort of void, consisting of nothing else but the painting. One way to test if something has intrinsic value by this second definition is to imagine it in a vacuum. Does the painting have value all by itself in the vacuum? If so, that value probably comes from its nonrelational properties - those things that can’t be separated from it. And, if this is true, that thing has intrinsic value. </p>

      <p> Jorge thinks that BMWs are amazing cars. Where others see them as a status symbol or something that’s fun to drive, Jorge really just values BMWs because they’re so well made. Does Jorge value BMWs intrinsically (by the second definition)? </p>

    <h3> Skill 2: Identify when someone is assigning extrinsic value to something </h3>
    <p> In the last Learn by Doing activity, we saw that Micah values <i>Ratatouille</i>
    because it makes them and their friend laugh. The fact that <i>Ratatouille</i> makes Micah 
    laugh is a <i>relational</i> property of the movie: it can be separated from the movie. 
    And, because this is what makes Micah value the movie, we say that it is <i>extrinsically valuable</i>. 
    Where valuing something intrinsically by the second definition means its value comes from its 
    <i>nonrelational (inseparable)</i> properties, valuing something extrinsically means its value comes 
    from its <i>relational (separable)</i> properties.</p>
