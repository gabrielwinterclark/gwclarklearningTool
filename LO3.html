    <h1>A Very Tiny Crash Course in Intrinsic Value</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objective 3: Learn why these concepts matter</h2>
    <h3>Skills:</h3>
    <p> <ol> <li> Skill 1: See how intrinsic value fits into value theory </li>
    <li> Skill 2: Learn about practical applications of value theory </li> </ol> </p>
    <p> You now understand both intrinsic vs. instrumental value and intrinsic vs. extrinsic value. Now, it is time to learn why all of this matters, both in other fields and in philosophy. We will start by learning about the branch of philosophy called “value theory” and how what we’ve learned so far fits into that branch. We will then look at a few practical applications of value theory.  </p>
    <h3> Skill 1: See how intrinsic value fits into value theory</h3>
    <p> Value theory is a branch of philosophy that explores theoretical questions about value and goodness. It draws from other branches of philosophy including ethics, aesthetics, and social and political philosophy. Value theory is concerned with questions like these: What is valuable? What is important? What things are good, and how good are they? And why are they good, anyway?</p>
    <p> As you may already have been able to tell, the concepts of intrinsic vs. instrumental value and intrinsic vs. extrinsic value help us answer these philosophical questions. They help us think about what sorts of things are valuable, and why they are valuable to us.</p>

    <h3> Skill 2: Learn about practical applications of value theory </h3>
    <p> So, how can we put value theory for use? Here are a few among many examples:
    <ul><li><b>Environmental policy:</b> When deciding what environmental policies to put in place, we need to ask what is valuable to us. There are philosophers who say that nature is intrinsically valuable. (Just don’t ask any of them what nature is - do that, and you’re in for hours of discussion!) One idea that we’ve uncovered in the public sphere is that more restrictive environmental policies will lead to economic devastation. What do you think of this? A clear understanding of what is valuable and <i>why</li> can help us navigate this issue, and others like it.</li>
    <li><b>Education:</b> There is substantial evidence that students who value education for its own sake (because learning is <i>satisfying</i> and <i>joyful</i> and <i>fun</i>) usually have better learning outcomes than those who value education as a means to an end (perhaps to get a job). Research is also emerging on how we can get students to value learning intrinsically. What do you think? At the beginning of this course, I asked you why you found the course important. Looking back, what do you think of your answer? What type of value do you think you assigned to the course? Do you think that affected how much fun you had, or how much you learned?</li>
    <li><b>Human well-being:</b> There are many philosophical theories of human well-being, but going into those theories in detail is beyond the scope of this very tiny course. However, there is one theory in particular that you may be interested in. It goes like this. In order to live a meaningful life, you must be dedicating your time to something that you find <i>intrinsically valuable</i> by the first definition: something that you value for its own sake, as an end. This doesn’t mean you need to work a job that has you jumping with joy every day. If you do find your job intrinsically valuable, wonderful! But if you don’t, as the theory goes, your work should be in service of something you <i>do</i> find intrinsically valuable, like being able to take care of and spend time with your family every day.
</li></ul></p>
    <p> These are just a few applications. Value theory can be applied to any field of study that would benefit from asking “evaluative” questions: questions about what people value, why they value it, and how we can use that information.</p>
