    <h1>A Very Tiny Crash Course in Intrinsic Value</h1>
    <h2>Learning Objective 1: Understand intrinsic vs. instrumental value</h2>
    <p> <ol> <li> Skill 1: Identify when someone is assigning intrinsic value to something (first definition) </li>
    <li> Skill 2: Identify when someone is assigning instrumental value to something </li> </ol> </p>
    <p> In philosophy, there are actually two definitions of intrinsic value. 
    Each definition has a corresponding “opposite” sort of value. 
    In this learning objective, we will learn about the first definition of intrinsic value 
    and how it contrasts with its “opposite”: instrumental value. 
    We will learn about the second definition in the next learning objective. </p>

    <h3> Skill 1: Identify when someone is assigning intrinsic value to something (first definition) </h3>
    <p> By the first definition, something has intrinsic value when it is valuable as an end. 
    What does “valuable as an end” mean? 
    Well, something is valuable as an end when it’s valuable for itself, not in service of something else. </p>
    <p> Let's see if an example can help us understand even better. </p>
    <p> Example: I love sushi because it’s delicious, not because it gets or does anything for me. 
    The sushi doesn’t grow legs, buy a car and start running all my errands for me. 
    No, I love sushi just because I enjoy eating it. I value sushi <i>intrinsically</i>. 
    For me, the sushi has <i>intrinsic value</i>. </p>
    <p> Try thinking of something that you find intrinsically valuable. 
    What do you find interesting, enjoyable, or important on its own? </p>
  
    <h4> Learn By Doing Exercise #1 </h4>
    <form id="lo1-q1-form">
      <p> Jeremiah enjoys playing the cello for the joy of it. Does he value playing the cello intrinsically? </p>
      <input id="lo1-q1-a-input" type="radio" name="lo1-q1-answer" value="Learning Objective 1, Question 1: Correct (A)">Yes</p>
      <input id="lo1-q1-b-input" type="radio" name="lo1-q1-answer" value="Learning Objective 1, Question 1: Incorrect (B)">No</p>
      <input type="submit" id="" value="Submit"></input>
    </form>
    <p id="lo1-q1-feedback"></p>

    <h4> Learn By Doing Exercise #2 </h4>
    <form id="lo1-q2-form">
      <p> May plays the cello because it supports her financially. She actually doesn’t like playing the cello very much, but she likes that it pays her bills. Does May value playing the cello intrinsically? </p>
      <input id="lo1-q2-a-input" type="radio" name="lo1-q2-answer" value="Learning Objective 1, Question 2: Incorrect (A)">Yes</p>
      <input id="lo1-q2-b-input" type="radio" name="lo1-q2-answer" value="Learning Objective 1, Question 2: Correct (B)">No</p>
      <input type="submit" id="" value="Submit"></input>
    </form>
    <p id="lo1-q2-feedback"></p>
  
    <h3> Skill 2: Identify when someone is assigning instrumental value to something </h3>
    <p> By the first definition, something has intrinsic value when it’s valued <i>as an end, for itself</i>. 
    In contrast, something has <i>instrumental</i> value when it’s valued because <i>as a means</i> to get something else. 
    In the previous Learn By Doing exercise, you heard about May, who values playing the cello instrumentally. 
    She values playing the cello because it pays her bills: for May, 
    playing the cello is a <i>means</i> to get money. </p>
